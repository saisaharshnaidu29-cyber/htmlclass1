        <p>The peacock is India's national bird, known for its vibrant blue and green feathers and its iconic, eye-spotted tail that males fan out to attract mates. These beautiful birds are found in various habitats, including forests and farms, and are respected for their cultural significance and graceful appearance. A male peacock's long, decorative train, which is longer than its body, makes it a breathtaking sight.</p>
